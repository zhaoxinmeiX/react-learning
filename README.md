# React Learning Journey 🚀

A comprehensive React development playground built with **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Material UI (MUI)**. This project serves as a structured learning path covering essential React concepts from basics to advanced patterns.

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository document my journey in mastering modern React. It is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific core concept:

- **🏗️ Context API**: Global state management and avoiding prop-drilling.
- **📝 Forms**: Handling user input, validation, and controlled components.
- **🌐 API Integration**: Fetching and displaying data from external services.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18**: Frontend library.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast build tool and dev server.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: Professional UI component library.
